# Open-source software (OSS) inspection

## Orientation
- Read README, docs, CONTRIBUTING, and architecture notes first
- Run the test suite to establish a working baseline
- Identify entry points and core flows

## Structure mapping
- Inspect repo layout and build system
- Use git history to find hotspots and critical modules
- Create dependency graphs or call graphs where appropriate

## Notes
- Respect license terms and contribution guidelines
- Prefer changes that are test-backed and reversible
