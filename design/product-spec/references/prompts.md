# Spec Prompts (Minimal)

## Socratic Spec Reviewer

Ask:
- What single core problem does this solve?
- Who is the primary user and what do they do today?
- What proves success (metric + target)?
- What is in-scope vs explicitly out-of-scope?
- What would make this fail in the real world?

## UX Ambiguity Killer

Ask:
- What does the user believe is happening?
- What action is possible on each screen/component?
- What state appears when data is empty/loading/error?
- What must never be implied?

## Build Plan Decomposer

Ask:
- What are the smallest epics to deliver value?
- What are the smallest stories per epic with AC?
- What tests validate each story?
- What is the rollback plan?
