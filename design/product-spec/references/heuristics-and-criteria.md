# Heuristics and Criteria (Concise)

Use this reference to deepen reviews without bloating the main skill. Prefer the most relevant subset.

## Usability Heuristics (quick scan)
- Visibility of system status: clear feedback, progress, and state changes.
- Match between system and real world: user language, familiar mental models.
- User control and freedom: undo/redo, escape routes.
- Consistency and standards: platform conventions, internal consistency.
- Error prevention: constraints, inline guidance, safe defaults.
- Recognition over recall: visible options, progressive disclosure.
- Flexibility and efficiency: shortcuts, smart defaults, power paths.
- Aesthetic and minimalist design: remove noise, keep focus.
- Help users recover from errors: clear messages, next steps.
- Help and documentation: contextual help when needed.

## Accessibility Baseline (WCAG 2.2 AA oriented)
- Keyboard access and focus visibility; no traps.
- Sufficient contrast; legible text sizing and line length.
- Non-text alternatives for icons/images; clear labels.
- Error identification and suggestions; status messages announced.
- Motion sensitivity: respect reduced motion.
- Target sizes and spacing for touch.

## Content and Microcopy
- Task-focused, concrete, and action-first.
- Avoid ambiguity, jargon, or marketing in critical flows.
- Make consequences explicit for destructive actions.
- Provide inline examples for complex inputs.

## Trust, Privacy, and Safety
- Explain why data is requested, when it is used, and retention.
- Avoid dark patterns: forced consent, hidden costs, guilt language.
- Clear security cues for payments or sensitive actions.

## Performance and Resilience
- Use skeletons or progressive disclosure for slow content.
- Handle empty, error, and offline states gracefully.
- Preserve user input on failure when possible.

## Evidence Sources to Prefer (when available)
- Analytics drop-off or funnel data
- Session replay or usability test notes
- Support tickets or feedback themes
- A/B or experiment results
