# Web Heuristics and Criteria (Concise)

Use this reference for web-specific UX reviews.

## Usability Heuristics
- Clear system status, progress, and feedback for async actions.
- Familiar web conventions for navigation, forms, and interactions.
- Visible focus states and predictable tab order.
- Consistent component patterns across pages.

## Accessibility (WCAG 2.2 AA oriented)
- Keyboard-only navigation for all interactive elements.
- Focus visibility and no keyboard traps.
- Color contrast meets AA; text sizes and line length are legible.
- Semantic HTML with proper headings and landmarks.
- Form labels, errors, and status messages announced (ARIA where needed).
- Respect reduced motion; avoid motion-triggered discomfort.
- Target sizes and spacing for touch and trackpad.

## Content and Microcopy
- Action-first labels; avoid vague CTAs.
- Plain language and concrete outcomes.
- Error messages: what happened, why, and how to fix.

## Trust and Safety
- Transparent pricing, fees, and data use.
- No dark patterns or misleading consent.

## Performance and Resilience
- Skeletons or progressive loading for slower content.
- Handle empty, error, and offline states.
- Preserve form data on submission failure.
