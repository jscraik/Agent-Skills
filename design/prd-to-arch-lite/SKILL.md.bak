# PRD to Architecture Lite

## Pipeline Context
This skill generates a minimal architecture snapshot, typically as part of **Stage 3 of the Spec Pipeline** (Build Plan) for demo-grade work.

**Related stages:**
- Stage 1: Foundation Spec (What + Why) — See `design/product-spec` or use `design/references/foundation-spec-template.md`
- Stage 2: UX Spec (How it feels) — See `design/product-spec` or use `design/references/ux-spec-template.md`
- Stage 3: Build Plan (How we execute) — See `design/product-spec` or use `design/references/build-plan-template.md`

**Shared references:**
- `design/references/build-plan-template.md` — Build Plan template
- `design/references/spec-linter-checklist.md` — Quality gate checklist

## Response format (strict)
The first line of any response MUST be `## Inputs`.
Every response must include:
- `## Inputs`
- `## Outputs`
- `## When to use`

Generate a minimal architecture snapshot for demo-grade builds.

## Output location
Write the snapshot in the same directory as the source PRD.
- `feature-x.md` -> `feature-x-arch-lite.md`

## Required sections (concise)
1) Scope boundary (in/out)
2) Core components (3-7 items)
3) One primary flow (bulleted)
4) Key risks (top 3)

## Diagram
- One Mermaid flowchart for the primary flow.

## Constraints
- No deployment topology, scaling, or vendor decisions.
- Redact secrets/PII by default.
- Mark assumptions explicitly.
## References
- Contract: references/contract.yaml
- Evals: references/evals.yaml

## When to use
- Use this skill when the task matches its description and triggers.
- If the request is outside scope, route to the appropriate skill.

## Inputs
- User request details and any relevant files/links.

## Outputs
- A structured response or artifact appropriate to the skill.
- Include `schema_version: 1` if outputs are contract-bound.

## Constraints
- Redact secrets/PII by default.
- Avoid destructive operations without explicit user direction.

## Validation
- Run any relevant checks or scripts when available.
- Fail fast and report errors before proceeding.

## Anti-patterns
- NEVER skip component boundaries—even minimal architectures need clear separation.
- DO NOT omit the primary flow—without it, the architecture is meaningless.
- Avoid over-engineering demo architectures—minimal doesn't mean missing key elements.
- DO NOT skip top risks—ignoring risks guarantees surprises during implementation.
- Favor clarity, explicit tradeoffs, and verifiable outputs.

## Procedure
1) Clarify scope and inputs.
2) Execute the core workflow.
3) Summarize outputs and next steps.



## Response format (required)
The first line of any response MUST be `## Inputs`.
Every user-facing response must include these headings:
- `## Inputs`
- `## Outputs`
- `## When to use`

## Examples
- "Use this skill for a typical request in its domain."

Failure/out-of-scope template (use verbatim structure):
```markdown
## Inputs
Objective: <what you received>

Plan:
1) <brief>
2) <brief>

Next step: <single request>

## Outputs
- <what would be produced if in scope>

## When to use
- <when this skill applies>
```
