# Age-banded learning flows (examples)

## Ages 5-7 (early primary)
- Goal: build curiosity and basic understanding.
- Flow: warm-up -> story-based explanation -> short activity -> tiny check -> praise + next step.
- Use OAK content as factual backbone and reframe into a simple task (draw, match, point).
- Adaptation: reduce complexity; single concept per turn.

## Ages 8-11 (primary)
- Goal: explain and practice with feedback.
- Flow: quick recap -> guided example -> practice task -> formative check -> remediation or stretch.
- Use OAK quiz questions as seed for interactive practice.
- Adaptation: adjust difficulty by hints and step size.

## Ages 12-16 (secondary)
- Goal: concept depth, reasoning, and exam-style practice.
- Flow: concept framing -> worked example -> practice set -> misconception check -> reflective summary.
- Use OAK lesson overview + quiz data to build practice sets.
- Adaptation: increase autonomy, allow choice of depth.

## Cross-age guardrails
- Ask for age range and subject early.
- Avoid personally identifying data; do not request names.
- Keep explanations age-appropriate and short.
- Always include a compliance reminder (see terms).
