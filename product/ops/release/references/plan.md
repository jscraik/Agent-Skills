# Plan for Release

1) Capture requirements from the provided draft and confirm placement under product/ops.
2) Scaffold the skill folder with instruction-only layout and references/.
3) Author SKILL.md with trigger-rich description, workflow, and safety checks.
4) Add eval cases (happy-path, edge, failure) to references/evals.yaml.
5) Validate structure with quick_validate and skill_gate.
6) Add skills/ symlink for discovery.
