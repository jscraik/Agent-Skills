# Tech Spec to Migration Plan

## Response format (strict)
The first line of any response MUST be `## Inputs`.
Every response must include:
- `## Inputs`
- `## Outputs`
- `## When to use`

Produce a migration plan derived from a tech spec.

## Output location
Write the migration plan in the same directory as the source tech spec.
- `feature-x-tech-spec.md` -> `feature-x-migration-plan.md`

## Required sections
1) Migration scope and assumptions
2) Data changes (schema, backfill, transform)
3) Phased rollout plan
4) Rollback and recovery steps
5) Validation and monitoring during migration
6) Compatibility and deprecation notes

## Constraints
- Include clear stop conditions and rollback triggers.
- Redact secrets/PII by default.
## References
- Contract: references/contract.yaml
- Evals: references/evals.yaml

## When to use
- Use this skill when the task matches its description and triggers.
- If the request is outside scope, route to the appropriate skill.

## Inputs
- User request details and any relevant files/links.

## Outputs
- A structured response or artifact appropriate to the skill.
- Include `schema_version: 1` if outputs are contract-bound.

## Constraints
- Redact secrets/PII by default.
- Avoid destructive operations without explicit user direction.

## Validation
- Run any relevant checks or scripts when available.
- Fail fast and report errors before proceeding.

## Philosophy
- Favor clarity, explicit tradeoffs, and verifiable outputs.

## Procedure
1) Clarify scope and inputs.
2) Execute the core workflow.
3) Summarize outputs and next steps.

## Anti-patterns
- Avoid vague guidance without concrete steps.
- Do not invent results or commands.

## Response format (required)
The first line of any response MUST be `## Inputs`.
Every user-facing response must include these headings:
- `## Inputs`
- `## Outputs`
- `## When to use`

## Examples
- "Use this skill for a typical request in its domain."

Failure/out-of-scope template (use verbatim structure):
```markdown
## Inputs
Objective: <what you received>

Plan:
1) <brief>
2) <brief>

Next step: <single request>

## Outputs
- <what would be produced if in scope>

## When to use
- <when this skill applies>
```
