# YouTube Hooks & Scripts

Transform raw ideas, braindumps, and code into compelling scripts that hook viewers in the first 30 seconds and keep them watching through long-form content.

## Philosophy: The Engagement Arc

Technical YouTube content fails when it teaches instead of tells. Viewers don't click for education—they click for **transformation**. They stay for the journey.

**Mental Model: The Conversational Journey**

```
Hook (Promise) → Tension (Stakes) → Journey (Discovery) → Payoff (Transformation)
```

This isn't a lecture structure. It's a conversation where you're guiding a friend through something you're genuinely excited about.

### Core Principles

1. **Conversation Over Presentation**: Write how you talk, not how you'd write docs. Technical accuracy doesn't require formal tone.

2. **Curiosity Before Explanation**: Every section should make viewers want the next section. Don't explain—reveal.

3. **Stakes Create Attention**: Why should they care NOW? What problem becomes real? What opportunity closes?

4. **Transformation Over Information**: The viewer after watching should be different from the viewer before. What changes?

5. **Your Voice Is The Product**: Authenticity beats polish. Genuine enthusiasm and honest uncertainty are more engaging than scripted perfection.

**The Hook Contract**: The first 30 seconds make a promise. The rest of the video must deliver on that specific promise—nothing more, nothing less.

## Before Writing a Script

Transform your raw input into clear understanding:

**From any input type, extract**:
- **Core Insight**: What's the one thing that made YOU excited about this?
- **Transformation**: How is the viewer different after watching?
- **Stakes**: Why does this matter now? What's the cost of not knowing?
- **Journey**: What discoveries will the viewer make along the way?

**Ask yourself**:
- "If I had 30 seconds with a friend, what would I say?"
- "What surprised me when I learned this?"
- "What do most people get wrong about this?"
- "What's the 'aha' moment I want viewers to experience?"

Good answers to these questions shape effective scripts.

## Interactive Discovery

Before writing, use **AskUserQuestion** to understand the creator's specific needs and source material.

### When to Ask Questions

**Always ask when**:
- User provides raw material (code, braindump, rough idea)
- Video structure and angle aren't clear
- Multiple valid approaches exist for the content

**Skip questions when**:
- User has already specified their approach clearly
- User provides a detailed outline
- Quick iteration on existing script

### Question Flow

**Question Set 1: Input & Angle**

```
Question: "What's your starting material for this video?"
Header: "Input type"
Options:
  - High-level idea (Just a concept, needs full development)
  - Braindump/notes (Scattered thoughts and key points)
  - Source code (Working code that needs storytelling)
  - Existing draft (Script that needs improvement)
```

```
Question: "What's the core angle or hook you're leaning toward?"
Header: "Angle"
Options:
  - The revelation (Something surprising or counterintuitive)
  - The journey (Building something step by step)
  - The comparison (Why X over Y, or evolution from A to B)
  - Not sure yet (Help me find the angle)
```

**Question Set 2: Structure & Depth**

```
Question: "How should the video be structured?"
Header: "Structure"
Options:
  - Linear build (Start simple, progressively add complexity)
  - Problem-solution (Show pain, then relief)
  - Story-driven (Personal experience frames the technical content)
  - Exploration (Discovery and experimentation feel)
```

```
Question: "How much should the script include?"
Header: "Detail level"
Options:
  - Full script (Every word I'll say, verbatim)
  - Detailed outline (Key points with talking points)
  - Beat sheet (Structure and hooks only, I'll improvise)
```

## Hook Frameworks

The hook is the first 30 seconds. It must create an **irresistible curiosity gap** while making a **clear promise**.

### Hook Anatomy

Every effective hook has three components:

1. **The Pattern Interrupt** (0-5 seconds)
   - Break expectations
   - Challenge assumptions
   - State something unexpected

2. **The Stakes** (5-15 seconds)
   - Why this matters NOW
   - What's the cost of not knowing?
   - What opportunity exists?

3. **The Promise** (15-30 seconds)
   - What will they learn/gain/understand?
   - How will they be different?
   - Why should they keep watching?

### Hook Patterns for Technical Content

**1. The Misconception Reveal**

```
"Everyone tells you to [common advice]. Here's why that's actually making your [outcome] worse."

"I spent [time] thinking [X] was the answer. Turns out I was solving the wrong problem entirely."

"The first thing most developers do with [technology] is [common approach]. And it's exactly why most [technology] projects fail."
```

Use when: Challenging conventional wisdom or common practices

**2. The Transformation Promise**

```
"By the end of this video, you'll understand [specific thing] better than [reference point]."

"This one concept changed how I think about [topic]. It's going to change how you [outcome] too."

"What if I told you that [complex thing] could actually become [simple/enjoyable/fast]?"
```

Use when: Teaching a concept or technique that has clear before/after states

**3. The Stakes Escalation**

```
"[Technology] is changing [field] right now. And most developers are going to be left behind because they're missing [key insight]."

"I almost shipped a bug that would have [consequence]. Here's what I learned."

"This is the code that [impressive outcome]. Let me show you how deceptively simple it actually is."
```

Use when: Creating urgency or highlighting real consequences

**4. The Curiosity Gap**

```
"There's a reason [impressive company/person] does [thing] this way. And it's not what you think."

"I'm about to show you something that made me completely rethink [topic]."

"This took me [time] to figure out. I'm going to save you that struggle."
```

Use when: You have a genuine insight that surprised you

**5. The Relatable Struggle**

```
"If you've ever felt like [common frustration], this video is for you."

"I used to hate [thing]. Then I discovered [approach]."

"Here's the problem: [common pain point]. And nobody talks about the real solution."
```

Use when: Addressing genuine pain points your audience experiences

### Hook Best Practices

**DO**:
- Start with energy and clarity
- Make a specific promise
- Create stakes that feel real
- Be honest about what the video delivers
- Match your actual speaking style

**DON'T**:
- Start with "Hey guys, welcome back"
- Promise more than you deliver
- Use generic openings ("In this video...")
- Start with context before intrigue
- Apologize or hedge in the first 30 seconds

## Script Structure for Long-Form

Long-form content (15+ minutes) requires **engagement beats** throughout, not just at the start.

### The Four-Act Structure

**Act 1: The Hook & Setup (0-3 minutes)**
- Hook (30 seconds)
- Stakes expansion (why this matters)
- Quick context (minimal—just enough to understand)
- Promise reinforcement (what they'll learn)

**Act 2: The Foundation (15-30% of runtime)**
- Core concepts they need
- But framed as discovery, not lecture
- Each concept should raise new questions
- End with a mini-cliffhanger into Act 3

**Act 3: The Core Journey (40-50% of runtime)**
- The meat of the content
- Multiple "aha" moments spaced out
- Rising complexity/stakes
- Moments of genuine exploration/discovery

**Act 4: The Payoff & Expansion (15-20% of runtime)**
- Deliver on the hook's promise
- Connect everything together
- Expand to implications/next steps
- End strong with memorable takeaway

### Engagement Beats

Every 2-4 minutes, include an **engagement beat**:

**Mini-hooks**:
```
"But here's where it gets interesting..."
"This is the part most tutorials skip..."
"Now watch what happens when..."
"This next part is what changed everything for me..."
```

**Reorientation points**:
```
"So now we have [X]. But we still need to solve [Y]."
"Remember the problem from earlier? This is how we fix it."
"Let's zoom out and see what we've actually built."
```

**Curiosity escalation**:
```
"What I'm about to show you took me [time] to figure out."
"This looks simple but there's something subtle happening."
"Most people stop here. We're going further."
```

### Pacing for Retention

**Fast sections** (under 60 seconds each):
- Simple concepts
- Setup and context
- Transitions between topics

**Slow sections** (2-4 minutes each):
- Core explanations
- Important code walkthroughs
- "Aha moment" revelations

**Breathing room**:
- Recap after complexity
- Pause before major transitions
- Visual changes to reset attention

## Working with Different Inputs

### From a High-Level Idea

**Process**:
1. State the idea in one sentence
2. Ask: "Why would someone care about this?"
3. Find the tension: What problem does this solve? What's surprising?
4. Identify the transformation: What does the viewer gain?
5. Structure: Hook → Context → Journey → Payoff

**Example**:
```
Idea: "Video about using Claude for code review"

Tension: "Most AI code review content shows basic stuff.
Real code review is nuanced—can AI actually help there?"

Transformation: "Viewer learns a workflow that catches
issues they'd normally miss"

Angle: "What if your AI code reviewer was smarter than
most junior developers?"
```

### From a Braindump/Notes

**Process**:
1. Read everything without judgment
2. Circle the "spicy" parts—what's surprising, useful, or contrarian?
3. Find the throughline: What connects the interesting bits?
4. Identify the core insight: If only one thing survives, what is it?
5. Structure around that insight, use other material as support

**Key principle**: A braindump is a treasure hunt. Most of it is context for YOUR understanding. The video needs only the gold.

### From Source Code

**Process**:
1. What does this code DO? (One sentence)
2. What's clever or surprising about HOW it does it?
3. What problem did you face before this code existed?
4. What would someone need to understand to appreciate this?
5. Structure: Problem → Failed approaches → The insight → The code → The result

**Code storytelling principles**:
- Don't explain code line-by-line (boring)
- Explain the THINKING that led to the code
- Show evolution: bad → better → good
- Highlight the "aha" moment in the code
- Let complexity earn its place through story

**Example**:
```
Code: Complex async batching implementation

Story: "I was hitting rate limits. My first attempt was
simple delays. Then I tried queuing. Then I realized
the real problem was [insight]. Here's the code that
came from that realization."
```

### From an Existing Draft

**Process**:
1. Read once without editing
2. Ask: "Where did I get bored?" (That's where viewers leave)
3. Identify the actual hook (often buried in minute 2-3)
4. Move the hook to the start
5. Cut everything that doesn't serve the core promise
6. Add engagement beats every 2-4 minutes

---

## Writing for Your Voice

### Conversational Technical Writing

**NOT this**:
```
"In this section, we will examine the implementation
details of the async batching system, which provides
significant performance improvements."
```

**THIS**:
```
"Okay, here's where it gets good. This little piece of
code? It's doing something sneaky that cuts our API
calls in half."
```

### Voice Markers to Include

**Authentic enthusiasm**:
```
"I love this part."
"This blew my mind when I figured it out."
"Honestly, this is so satisfying."
```

**Honest uncertainty**:
```
"I'm not 100% sure this is the best approach, but..."
"This might be controversial, but..."
"I struggled with this for a while."
```

**Direct audience connection**:
```
"You've probably run into this."
"If you're like me..."
"Here's what I wish someone had told me."
```

**Natural transitions**:
```
"So..." "Anyway..." "Here's the thing..."
"But wait—" "Actually—" "Okay so—"
```

### What Makes It Sound Like YOU

**Include**:
- Your actual reactions ("wait, what?")
- Your thinking process ("my first instinct was...")
- Your mistakes ("I totally got this wrong at first")
- Your opinions ("I personally prefer...")

**Avoid**:
- Over-explaining simple things
- Corporate/formal language
- Generic YouTube phrases
- Excessive hedging

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ The Buried Hook

```
"Hey everyone, welcome back to the channel. Before we
get started, make sure to like and subscribe. Today
we're going to talk about... [2 minutes later] ...and
THAT'S why this matters."
```

**Why bad**: Hook at minute 2 means viewers left at second 30

**Better**: Start with the compelling part. Do housekeeping later (or never).

### ❌ The Info Dump

```
"First, let me explain what an API is. An API stands for
Application Programming Interface. APIs were invented in...
[5 minutes of background] ...okay now let's get to the
actual point."
```

**Why bad**: Context without stakes is boring. Viewers don't need to know everything.

**Better**: Provide just-in-time context woven into the journey.

### ❌ The Promise Mismatch

```
Hook: "I'm going to show you how to 10x your productivity"
Content: Basic tips that might save 5 minutes a day
```

**Why bad**: Destroys trust. Viewers feel tricked.

**Better**: Match the hook's promise exactly to what you deliver.

### ❌ The Monotone Middle

```
[Engaging hook]
[15 minutes of steady, same-paced explanation]
[Sudden conclusion]
```

**Why bad**: No engagement beats = drop-off at minute 5

**Better**: Vary pace, include mini-hooks, add engagement beats every 2-4 minutes.

### ❌ The Code Walkthrough

```
"On line 1, we import React. On line 2, we define our
component. On line 3..."
```

**Why bad**: Code reading is not content. Understanding is.

**Better**: Explain the thinking, show the evolution, highlight the "aha."

### ❌ The Robotic Script

```
"In conclusion, we have examined the three key aspects
of this implementation. These aspects are important
because they enable developers to..."
```

**Why bad**: Sounds like a term paper, not a conversation.

**Better**: Write like you talk. Read it aloud. If it sounds weird, rewrite it.

## Variation Guidance

**IMPORTANT**: Scripts should vary based on:

- **Content type**: Tutorial vs. insight piece vs. build video
- **Energy level**: High-energy discovery vs. thoughtful analysis
- **Input material**: Code-heavy vs. concept-heavy
- **Audience familiarity**: New topic vs. advanced technique

**Avoid converging on patterns**:
- Don't always start with "The misconception reveal" hook
- Don't always use four-act structure for every video
- Vary your opening energy based on topic
- Mix explanation styles (visual, verbal, demo)

**Each video is different**:
- A "here's what I built" video needs different energy than a "here's what I learned" video
- A complex topic needs more breathing room than a quick tip
- Your hundredth video on a topic can assume more than your first

## Output Formats

Based on user preference, deliver scripts in one of these formats:

### Full Script

Complete word-for-word script with stage directions:

```markdown
## HOOK (0:00-0:30)

[ENERGY: High, direct to camera]

Everyone tells you to use useEffect for data fetching.
Here's why that advice is actually making your React apps worse.

[PAUSE - let it land]

I spent six months building apps the "right way" before I
figured out what I'm about to show you. This changed everything.

## SECTION 1: The Problem (0:30-2:00)

[ENERGY: Conversational, slight frustration]

So here's the thing...
```

### Detailed Outline

Key points with talking points:

```markdown
## HOOK (30 seconds)
- Pattern interrupt: Challenge useEffect convention
- Stakes: "making your apps worse"
- Promise: Alternative approach that changes everything
- Key line: "This changed everything"

## SECTION 1: The Problem (90 seconds)
- Show typical useEffect pattern
- Explain why it SEEMS right
- Reveal the hidden issues (race conditions, cleanup)
- Talking points:
  - "The tutorial approach vs. production reality"
  - "Works in dev, breaks in prod"
```

### Beat Sheet

Structure and hooks only:

```markdown
0:00 - HOOK: Challenge useEffect orthodoxy
0:30 - PROBLEM: Show what goes wrong
2:00 - [ENGAGEMENT BEAT]: "Here's where it gets interesting"
2:15 - CONTEXT: Brief history of data fetching in React
4:00 - [ENGAGEMENT BEAT]: "Most tutorials stop here"
4:15 - SOLUTION PART 1: React Query intro
7:00 - [ENGAGEMENT BEAT]: "But this is the part that changed everything"
7:15 - SOLUTION PART 2: The mental model shift
10:00 - DEMO: Refactoring real code
14:00 - PAYOFF: Before/after comparison
15:00 - CLOSE: Key takeaway + next steps
```

---

## Remember

**Scripts are conversations, not presentations.**

The best technical YouTube scripts:
- Hook viewers with genuine curiosity, not manufactured hype
- Maintain engagement through discovery, not information
- Sound like the creator actually talks
- Deliver exactly what the hook promises
- Create transformation, not just education

**The Engagement Equation**:
```
Authentic Voice + Clear Stakes + Spaced Revelations = Viewers Stay
```

These frameworks illuminate the path—they don't constrain your creativity. Trust your instincts about what's interesting. If you're genuinely excited, that comes through.

**Your authenticity is your unfair advantage. Lean into it.**
