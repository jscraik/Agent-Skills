# Hook Patterns for Technical Content

Extended examples and variations for the hook frameworks in the main skill.

## The Misconception Reveal

### Pattern Structure
```
[Common belief] + [Why it's wrong] + [Better alternative teaser]
```

### Examples by Technical Domain

**Web Development**:
```
"useEffect for data fetching is the first thing every React tutorial
teaches. It's also why most React apps have race conditions, memory
leaks, and loading state nightmares. Here's what senior developers
actually use instead."

"You've probably been told to never use any. Here's why TypeScript's
any is actually a powerful tool—when you use it intentionally."

"CSS Grid vs Flexbox? You're asking the wrong question. The best
layouts use both, and I'm going to show you exactly when to reach
for each one."
```

**AI/ML Content**:
```
"Everyone's obsessed with fine-tuning. Meanwhile, the best AI
engineers I know almost never do it. Here's what they do instead."

"Prompt engineering is a skill. But not the way you think. The
'clever tricks' everyone shares? Most of them don't scale. Here's
what actually matters."

"RAG is the answer to everything, right? Wrong. I've watched three
production RAG systems fail in the same way. Let me show you the
pattern—and how to avoid it."
```

**DevOps/Infrastructure**:
```
"'Move fast and break things.' Great advice—until you're on-call
at 3 AM. Here's how actually fast teams stay fast without the chaos."

"Microservices will solve your scaling problems. Except when they
create ten new ones. Let me show you the decision framework that
Google actually uses."

"Docker makes everything reproducible. Unless you make these three
mistakes that almost every team makes in their Dockerfiles."
```

### Variations

**The "Actually" Reveal**:
```
"[Common practice] actually [unexpected consequence]"
```

**The Authority Contradiction**:
```
"[Respected source] says [advice]. But [evidence/experience] shows [reality]"
```

**The Self-Correction**:
```
"I used to [common practice]. Then I [learned/discovered] [insight]"
```

## The Transformation Promise

### Pattern Structure
```
[End state] + [Credibility marker] + [Journey preview]
```

### Examples

**Skill Acquisition**:
```
"By the end of this video, TypeScript generics won't just make sense
—they'll become your favorite feature. I know that sounds crazy if
you're struggling with them now. But there's a mental model that
makes everything click."

"In the next 20 minutes, you're going to understand async/await
better than 90% of JavaScript developers. Not because you'll know
more—because you'll understand the WHY behind every quirk."
```

**Mindset Shifts**:
```
"After watching this, you'll never look at error handling the same
way. What feels like tedious boilerplate right now? It's actually
the most important code you write. Let me show you why."

"This is the video that will change how you think about testing.
Not more tests—smarter tests. And once you see the pattern, you
can't unsee it."
```

**Capability Unlock**:
```
"What if I told you that you could build production AI features
in an afternoon? Not toy demos—actual features your users will love.
Here's exactly how."

"You're about to learn the deployment strategy that lets indie devs
ship like enterprise teams. Zero DevOps experience required."
```

## The Stakes Escalation

### Pattern Structure
```
[Consequence/urgency] + [Specific scope] + [Promise of solution]
```

### Examples

**Career/Professional Stakes**:
```
"AI is about to change how we write code. And most developers are
preparing for the wrong future. In this video, I'm going to show
you exactly what skills matter—and what's becoming obsolete."

"The developers who understand this concept get promoted faster.
Not because it's complicated, but because it's invisible until
someone points it out. Let me be that someone."
```

**Technical Stakes**:
```
"This bug cost my client $50,000. It took 3 lines to fix. Here's
how to spot it before it costs you."

"Your React app is probably re-rendering 10x more than it should.
Here's how to find the hidden renders—and kill them."

"Every day your test suite takes 10 minutes instead of 1 minute
costs your team hours of productivity. Let me show you the fix
that takes 20 minutes to implement."
```

**Opportunity Stakes**:
```
"There's a window right now to learn AI-assisted coding before it
becomes table stakes. That window is closing. Here's how to use it."

"The tools I'm about to show you don't exist in any tutorial yet.
You're getting a head start that most developers won't have for months."
```

## The Curiosity Gap

### Pattern Structure
```
[Interesting observation] + [Withheld explanation] + [Earn the reveal]
```

### Examples

**The "Secret" Pattern**:
```
"There's a reason every production codebase I've seen uses this
pattern. It's not in any tutorial. It's not even documented most
places. But it solves a problem you definitely have."

"Watch what happens when I change one line of this code. That
behavior? It's not a bug. It's a feature—and understanding why
changes how you think about the entire language."
```

**The Discovery Narrative**:
```
"I stumbled onto something weird while debugging last week.
Turns out it's not weird at all—it's by design. And once I
understood why, it solved a problem I'd been ignoring for years."

"This code shouldn't work. By everything I knew about JavaScript,
it should throw an error. But it doesn't. And the reason why is
genuinely fascinating."
```

**The Expert Insight**:
```
"I watched a senior engineer solve in 10 minutes what took me
a day. The difference wasn't experience—it was one mental model
I was missing. Let me give it to you."

"There's a question I ask before writing any code now. It's not
about architecture, testing, or performance. But it's made my
code better than any of those things."
```

## The Relatable Struggle

### Pattern Structure
```
[Shared pain point] + [Validation] + [Path to relief]
```

### Examples

**Frustration Acknowledgment**:
```
"If you've ever stared at a TypeScript error message and felt
like the compiler was written by aliens—this video is for you.
There's a translation guide that makes every error obvious."

"Testing feels like eating your vegetables. Good for you,
not actually enjoyable. I'm going to change your mind. Not by
making you test more—by showing you the tests that actually matter."

"Tutorial hell is real. You finish a course, feel accomplished,
and then stare at a blank editor with no idea what to build.
Here's how to break out."
```

**Imposter Syndrome Address**:
```
"That voice that says 'real developers don't struggle with this'?
It's lying. Everyone struggles. But here's the thing—some people
have better mental models. Today, you get theirs."

"I've been coding for 15 years and I still Google basic syntax.
That's not a confession—it's a strategy. Let me show you how
the best developers actually work."
```

## Combining Patterns

The most effective hooks often combine multiple patterns:

### Misconception + Stakes
```
"Everyone says to start with tests. But starting with tests on the
wrong abstraction costs MORE time than no tests at all. Here's how
to know when you're ready—and when you're just procrastinating."
```

### Curiosity + Transformation
```
"There's a pattern I've never seen in tutorials, but I've seen in
every successful production system I've worked on. By the end of
this video, you'll know it too—and you'll use it everywhere."
```

### Struggle + Stakes + Promise
```
"If debugging feels random—like sometimes you find bugs fast and
sometimes you wander for hours—it's not you. It's your process.
And there's a system that makes debugging predictable. I'm going
to give it to you in the next 15 minutes."
```

## Hook Testing Checklist

Before finalizing a hook, verify:

- [ ] **First 5 seconds**: Pattern interrupt present? Attention grabbed?
- [ ] **Stakes clear**: Does viewer know why this matters to THEM?
- [ ] **Promise specific**: Do they know what they'll get?
- [ ] **Authenticity**: Does this sound like how you actually talk?
- [ ] **Deliverable**: Can the video ACTUALLY deliver this promise?
- [ ] **Curiosity gap**: Is there a reason to keep watching?

## Common Hook Failures

### The Weak Opening
```
"So today I want to talk about React hooks."
```
**Problem**: No stakes, no curiosity, no reason to watch.

### The Overpromise
```
"This will make you a 10x developer in 30 minutes."
```
**Problem**: Viewers don't believe it. Sets up disappointment.

### The Humble Brag
```
"I've been a senior engineer for 15 years and..."
```
**Problem**: Credentials don't create curiosity.

### The Generic
```
"React hooks are really useful."
```
**Problem**: Could be said about anything. No specificity.

### The Delayed Hook
```
"Before I get into this, make sure to like and subscribe..."
```
**Problem**: Hook buried after housekeeping. Viewers leave.
