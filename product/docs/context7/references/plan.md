# Plan: context7 skill gold compliance

1) Update SKILL.md description to meet WHAT+WHEN guidance and length limits.
2) Add required sections (Philosophy, Inputs, Outputs, Constraints, Validation, Antipatterns) and examples.
3) Add references/contract.yaml and references/evals.yaml.
4) Run quick_validate.py, then skill_gate.py to confirm compliance.
