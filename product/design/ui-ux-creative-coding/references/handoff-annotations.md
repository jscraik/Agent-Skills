# Handoff annotations (UI Collective distilled)

Use when preparing design → developer handoff.

## What developers need
- **Explicit behavior**: tooltips, edge cases, empty/error states.
- **Accessibility intent**: semantics, labels, keyboard paths.

## Annotation guidance
- Do not restate spacing that Dev Mode already shows.
- Add **semantic meaning** and **interaction rules** instead.

## Walkthroughs
- Record a short **screen‑capture walkthrough** for complex flows.
- Narrate intent and edge cases to reduce guesswork.

## Responsive guidance
- Provide mobile/tablet variants where **layout structure changes**.
- Avoid creating mobile variants for simple components that only scale.

## Checklist
- Are non‑happy paths annotated?
- Are accessibility expectations explicit?
- Is there a walkthrough for complex flows?
