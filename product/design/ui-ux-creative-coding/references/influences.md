# Influences (Jan 2026)

This skill is inspired by the following design-engineering / creative-coding voices.
Use these links as “study sets” when you need a fresh pattern or a polish reference.

**How to use these notes:**
- Pick **one influence** to lead the solution (voice + tradeoffs).
- Use **Emil + Jhey** notes for motion/micro-interactions by default.
- Cite the note files when explaining timing/easing or interaction decisions.

## @jh3yy (Jhey Tompkins)
- Craft of UI: https://craftofui.com/
- CodePen profile: https://codepen.io/jh3yy
- X: https://x.com/jh3yy

Study focus:
- Platform-first effects (CSS masks/filters/transforms)
- Micro-interactions as tiny systems (states + timing + a11y)
- Production‑ready craft: semantic elements first, avoid `<div role=button>`
- CSS techniques to study: `anchor()` alignment + `@starting-style` for smoother enters
- Reduce-motion and performance-first defaults

## @PixalJanitor (Pixel Janitor / Derek Briggs)

- (If you follow Shape FM): https://shape.fm/

Study focus:
- Design engineering mindset (systems that accelerate shipping)
- Reusable primitives + constraints

## @willking
- X: https://x.com/willking

Study focus:
- “Vibe coding” workflows: fast variants → pick → refactor → ship
- Using AI without letting quality drift

## @emilkowalski
- Animations course/site: https://animations.dev/
- Sonner (toast): https://github.com/emilkowalski/sonner
- Vaul (drawer): https://github.com/emilkowalski/vaul

Study focus:
- Motion as UX communication (not decoration)
- Timing + easing as first-class design decisions
- “Best animation is no animation” when clarity doesn’t improve
- Consistent choreography across components
- CSS-first building blocks (transforms, clip-path, filters)
