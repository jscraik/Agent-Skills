# Multi‑brand strategy (UI Collective distilled)

Use when a design system must support multiple brands.

## Choose a model
- **Branded house:** brands share structure; color swaps drive differences.
- **House of brands:** brands are visually distinct; requires more separation.

## Practical guidance
- Build a **master system** for Brand A first.
- Duplicate the system for Brand B only after Brand A is stable.
- Avoid swapping massive variable collections in place; it is error‑prone.

## Constraints (Figma reality)
- Figma supports **branded house** more cleanly than **house of brands**.
- Visual QA is required; tokens alone are not enough.

## Checklist
- Is the brand model explicitly chosen?
- Are foundations vs modules separated for reuse?
- Is visual QA planned alongside token export?
