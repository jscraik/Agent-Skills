# Gradient system (UI Collective distilled)

Use when gradients are a core part of the system.

## Core pattern
- Create a dedicated **Gradients & Opacity** collection.
- Name gradients by **stop direction** (Top, Bottom, Top‑Right), not “Gradient 1/2.”

## Stops + variants
- Define gradients by **stops** (Stop 1, Stop 2, optional mid‑stops).
- Keep a **default** and **inverse** variant.
- Use **opacity overlays** by applying opacity tokens to each stop.

## Scaling notes
- Multi‑brand systems often require **separate gradient collections** per brand.

## Checklist
- Are gradients named by direction?
- Are inverse + overlay variants defined?
- Are stop values consistent across themes?
