# Motion Spec (template)
# Keep motion consistent across the app.
# Prefer a small set of tokens over one-off values.

tokens:
  duration:
    instant: 0ms
    fast: 120ms
    normal: 180ms
    slow: 260ms
    xslow: 360ms

  easing:
    standard: "cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)"      # fast-out, slow-in
    emphasized: "cubic-bezier(0.2, 0.0, 0.0, 1.2)"   # a touch more snap (use sparingly)
    linear: "linear"

  spring:
    # If using a motion library, map to these "feels"
    subtle:
      stiffness: 380
      damping: 30
      mass: 1
    bouncy:
      stiffness: 420
      damping: 22
      mass: 1

rules:
  - Use motion to communicate state changes (open/close, success, error recovery).
  - Avoid continuous animation as decoration unless explicitly desired.
  - Avoid animating layout (height/width/top/left). Prefer transforms and opacity.
  - Keep UI responsive: no animation should block interaction completion.

reduced_motion:
  # If prefers-reduced-motion is enabled:
  - Replace movement with opacity/instant changes.
  - Remove non-essential flourish.
  - Keep essential state transitions but shorten durations.

patterns:
  dialog:
    open:
      opacity: { from: 0, to: 1, duration: normal, easing: standard }
      transform: { from: "translateY(4px) scale(0.98)", to: "translateY(0) scale(1)", duration: normal, easing: standard }
    close:
      opacity: { from: 1, to: 0, duration: fast, easing: standard }
      transform: { from: "translateY(0) scale(1)", to: "translateY(2px) scale(0.99)", duration: fast, easing: standard }

  toast:
    enter:
      opacity: { from: 0, to: 1, duration: fast, easing: standard }
      transform: { from: "translateY(8px)", to: "translateY(0)", duration: fast, easing: standard }
    exit:
      opacity: { from: 1, to: 0, duration: fast, easing: standard }
      transform: { from: "translateY(0)", to: "translateY(6px)", duration: fast, easing: standard }
