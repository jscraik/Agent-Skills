# Select and Combobox

## Intent
Allow users to pick from known options or search within them.

## Minimal pattern
- Use a select for small sets; combobox for large sets.
- Provide clear empty and loading states.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid embedding complex layouts inside options.

## Accessibility
- Use aria roles from a vetted primitive (Radix) and ensure keyboard support.
