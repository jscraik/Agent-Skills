# Carousel

## Intent
Show a small set of items in a horizontal scroll context.

## Minimal pattern
- Provide next/previous controls.
- Limit to a small number of items.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid auto-rotating carousels without user control.

## Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation and controls are labeled.
