# Accordion

## Intent
Collapse and expand sections to reduce page length.

## Minimal pattern
- Use for optional or secondary content.
- Keep one open by default if context requires it.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid nesting multiple accordions.

## Accessibility
- Use proper button semantics and aria-expanded.
