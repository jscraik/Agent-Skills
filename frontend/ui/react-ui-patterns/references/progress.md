# Progress Indicators

## Intent
Show task progress and reassure users during waiting periods.

## Minimal pattern
- Use progress bars for measurable tasks.
- Use spinners for indeterminate waits.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid fake progress that jumps unpredictably.

## Accessibility
- Use aria-valuenow/aria-valuemin/aria-valuemax for bars.
