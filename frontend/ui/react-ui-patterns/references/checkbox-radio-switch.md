# Checkbox, Radio, Switch

## Intent
Capture boolean or single-choice state.

## Minimal pattern
- Use checkbox for independent toggles.
- Use radio for single-choice groups.
- Use switch for immediate on/off settings.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid mixing checkbox and switch patterns for the same intent.

## Accessibility
- Ensure labels are clickable and focus states are visible.
