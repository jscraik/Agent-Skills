# Analytics Dashboards

## Intent
Provide clear, scannable summaries of key metrics and trends.

## Minimal pattern
- Lead with primary KPIs, then supporting charts and tables.
- Use consistent time ranges and comparison baselines.
- Provide filters with clear defaults and reset.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid mixing incompatible units or timeframes.
- Avoid dense dashboards without hierarchy.

## Accessibility
- Provide textual summaries for charts and KPIs.
- Ensure keyboard navigation for filters and cards.
