# File Upload

## Intent
Allow users to upload files with clear status and constraints.

## Minimal pattern
- Show accepted types and size limits.
- Provide progress and error feedback.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid silent failures or hidden constraints.

## Accessibility
- Ensure file input is reachable by keyboard and labeled.
