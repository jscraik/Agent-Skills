# Pagination

## Intent
Let users navigate large datasets in manageable chunks.

## Minimal pattern
- Provide next/previous and page count.
- Preserve filters and sort state across pages.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid pagination without clear item counts.

## Accessibility
- Ensure buttons are labeled and keyboard accessible.
