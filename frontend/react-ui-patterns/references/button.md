# Buttons

## Intent
Provide clear, accessible actions with consistent hierarchy.

## Minimal pattern
- Primary for the main action, secondary for supporting actions.
- Keep button text short and verb-driven.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid multiple primary buttons in one view.
- Avoid icon-only buttons without labels or aria-labels.

## Accessibility
- Ensure focus ring is visible.
- Use aria-label for icon-only buttons.
