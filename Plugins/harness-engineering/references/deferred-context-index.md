# Harness Engineering Deferred Context Index

HE active files must stay real plugin-owned text. Historical snapshots live
under `fixtures/**` or a dedicated archive reference; active paths must not
symlink into archives.

Use this index only when a compact stage file defers context. Do not paste
active procedure bodies here. Move durable behavior to a stage reference, link
the reference below, and let validators catch stale duplicated procedure text.

## Conditional Loading Map

Load references by trigger instead of by habit:

| Stage or condition | Load | Expected proof |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any stage writes durable docs, mutates files, or hands off | `references/stage-context-contract.md`, `references/lifecycle-exit-contract.md` | compact stage context plus exit status |
| Non-trivial durable HE artifact is operator-facing | `references/bluf-review-contract.md` | Command Summary with one opening BLUF paragraph, No-Fog Gate, or compact not-applicable reason |
| Stage choice is ambiguous | `references/routing-map.json`, `references/deterministic-stage-routing.md`, `references/interactive-steering-contract.md` | selected stage or one blocking question |
| `.harness` artifacts determine scope | `references/artifact-classification-and-traceability.md`, `references/artifact-routing-contract.md` | content-shape classification and Artifact Identity status |
| Non-trivial tracked work | `references/linear-tracker-gate.md` | resolved, created, blocked, or user-opted-out tracker status |
| Existing tracked plan or Linear-backed slice is consumed | `references/linear-delta-capture-gate.md` | delta admitted, rejected, or blocked before scope changes |
| Original prompt, external workflow, old manual method, or plugin comparison is the baseline | `references/source-prompt-coverage-contract.md` | source_prompt_status, evidence_depth, coverage_scope, not_inspected, repo-specific drift signals, authority limits, downstream_confidence, and next route |
| Coding-harness-managed repo | `references/coding-harness-command-bridge.md`, `references/execution-slice-contract.md` | command evidence or explicit blocked bridge fields |
| Stage could load broad domain, strategy, refactor, Linear, security, specialist, or eval gates | `references/gate-selection-contract.md` | smallest gate profile, required contracts, skipped contracts, and minimum proof |
| Stage would copy external process, add lifecycle surface area, expand governance, or preserve complexity without proven HE-specific failure evidence | `references/first-principles-contract.md` | first_principles_check with verified failure, smallest mechanism, decision type, rejected analogy, and proceed/ask/defer/reject/delete outcome |
| Plugin hook, `hooks/hooks.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` hook declaration, or hook-enforced guardrail appears in scope | `references/plugin-hook-capability-contract.md` | plugin_hook_capability_check with feature gate status, fallback path, portability status, side-effect class, lifecycle authority, and outcome |
| Domain-specific knowledge could sharpen output | `references/specialist-skill-steering-contract.md` | chosen specialist, skipped reason, or blocker |
| User choice affects downstream scope | `references/interactive-steering-contract.md` | asked choice, headless assumption, or blocked state |
| Product compression is the blocker | `references/agent-native-compression-contract.md` | subtractive proof, fresh-agent eval, and ablation gate |
| HE plugin confidence or budget quality is claimed | `references/plugin-eval-confidence-contract.md` | static plugin-eval result, rooted handle proof, release eval lane, and cache-sync status |
| Lifecycle stage risks ceremony, broad scope, weak feedback, or unclear value | `references/xp-operating-contract.md` | smallest valuable slice, feedback signal, slack policy, or blocked reason |
| Review or closure touches agent-facing workflow surfaces | `references/agent-native-audit-scorecard.md` | scorecard findings or not-applicable reason |
| Solved-problem evidence should persist | `references/solution-capture-contract.md` | refreshed existing solution or new `.harness/solutions/**` capture |

## Historical Context Policy

## Preserved Entry Point Lines

Preserved entrypoint lines from earlier compression rounds are intentionally
stored in archival fixtures and stage-specific preservation references, not in
this active router index.

Authoritative preservation locations:

- `fixtures/budget-archive/**`
- `fixtures/preserved-context/**`
- stage `references/source-prompt-preservation.md` files

Historical compact-entrypoint lines from prior compression passes belong in:

- `fixtures/budget-archive/**`
- `fixtures/preserved-context/**`
- stage `references/source-prompt-preservation.md` files

Do not duplicate active `SKILL.md` procedure text here. If future agents need
an old line for migration evidence, link the historical fixture path and state
why it matters instead of copying the line.

## Drift Signals

- The same reference appears twice under different labels.
- Preserved text copies active stage procedure instead of linking archival context.
- A preserved line contradicts the current stage entrypoint.
- This file grows faster than the referenced stage contracts.
- A validator, eval, or skill entrypoint treats this index as source of truth
  instead of a context router.

## Retired Entry Point Audit Notes

The 2026-05-08 artifact-traceability pass retired several oversized stage
entrypoint paragraphs. Their audit value is preserved by active stage diffs,
the relevant `skills/**/references/source-prompt-preservation.md` files, and
fixtures. Keep this index as a router only; do not paste retired procedure text
back into this file.

## 2026-05-12 BLUF Productization Preservation Notes

The BLUF productization pass compressed several stage entrypoints while keeping
their behavior in stage references, artifact contracts, and the BLUF review
contract. BLUF now means one opening Bottom Line Up Front paragraph, not a
section-by-section template. These exact retired lines are preserved so
progressive-disclosure validation can prove the context was moved rather than
silently dropped.
