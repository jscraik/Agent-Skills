# iOS design guidelines (Apple HIG summary)

Last verified: 2026-01-04

Source: Apple Human Interface Guidelines. This is the authoritative baseline.

## Core principles (Apple HIG)
- Clarity: prioritize legibility and a clear visual hierarchy.
- Deference: keep chrome minimal so content and actions are primary.
- Depth: use layering to convey hierarchy and interaction.
- Consistency: follow platform patterns for navigation, controls, and layout.

## Practical reminders
- Prefer platform-native navigation patterns (navigation bars, tabs, sheets) unless there is a compelling reason to deviate.
- Use system typography (San Francisco) and dynamic type; avoid hard-coded sizes.
- Use semantic colors and verify contrast across light/dark and accessibility modes.
