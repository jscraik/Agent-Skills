# Video Transcript Downloader

`./scripts/vtd.js` can:
- Print a transcript as a clean paragraph (timestamps optional).
- Download video/audio/subtitles.

Transcript behavior:
- YouTube: fetch via `youtube-transcript-plus` when possible.
- Otherwise: pull subtitles via `yt-dlp`, then clean into a paragraph.

## Setup

```bash
cd ~/Projects/agent-scripts/skills/video-transcript-downloader && npm ci
```

## Transcript (default: clean paragraph)

```bash
./scripts/vtd.js transcript --url 'https://…'
./scripts/vtd.js transcript --url 'https://…' --lang en
./scripts/vtd.js transcript --url 'https://…' --timestamps
./scripts/vtd.js transcript --url 'https://…' --keep-brackets
```

## Download video / audio / subtitles

```bash
./scripts/vtd.js download --url 'https://…' --output-dir ~/Downloads
./scripts/vtd.js audio --url 'https://…' --output-dir ~/Downloads
./scripts/vtd.js subs --url 'https://…' --output-dir ~/Downloads --lang en
```

## Formats (list + choose)

List available formats (format ids, resolution, container, audio-only, etc):

```bash
./scripts/vtd.js formats --url 'https://…'
```

Download a specific format id (example):

```bash
./scripts/vtd.js download --url 'https://…' --output-dir ~/Downloads -- --format 137+140
```

Prefer MP4 container without re-encoding (remux when possible):

```bash
./scripts/vtd.js download --url 'https://…' --output-dir ~/Downloads -- --remux-video mp4
```

## Notes

- Default transcript output is a single paragraph. Use `--timestamps` only when asked.
- Bracketed cues like `[Music]` are stripped by default; keep them via `--keep-brackets`.
- Pass extra `yt-dlp` args after `--` for `transcript` fallback, `download`, `audio`, `subs`, `formats`.

```bash
./scripts/vtd.js formats --url 'https://…' -- -v
```

## Troubleshooting (only when needed)

- Missing `yt-dlp` / `ffmpeg`:

```bash
brew install yt-dlp ffmpeg
```

- Verify:

```bash
yt-dlp --version
ffmpeg -version | head -n 1
```

## Scope and triggers
- Use this skill when the task matches its description and triggers.
- If the request is outside scope, route to the referenced skill.


## Required inputs
- User request details and any relevant files/links.


## Deliverables
- A structured response or artifact appropriate to the skill.
- Include `schema_version: 1` if outputs are contract-bound.


## Constraints
- Redact secrets/PII by default.
- Avoid destructive operations without explicit user direction.


## Validation
- Run any relevant checks or scripts when available.
- Fail fast and report errors before proceeding.


## Philosophy
- Favor clarity, explicit tradeoffs, and verifiable outputs.


## Anti-patterns
- Avoid vague guidance without concrete steps.
- Do not invent results or commands.
## Procedure
1) Clarify scope and inputs.
2) Execute the core workflow.
3) Summarize outputs and next steps.

## Antipatterns
- Do not add features outside the agreed scope.

## Examples
- "Provide a concise response for this task."
- "Follow the workflow and summarize outputs."

## Variation
- Vary tone, depth, and structure based on context.
- Avoid repeating the same outline across outputs.

## Remember
The agent is capable of extraordinary work in this domain. Use judgment, adapt to context, and push boundaries when appropriate.

## Philosophy and tradeoffs
- Use this skill when consistent decision-making matters more than one-off execution because project context should drive the approach.
- Principle and mindset: prioritize tradeoffs and constraints over rigid checklists; understand why each step exists.
- Ask this to keep outcomes robust: Why is this the right default, and what could change this outcome?
- How do we adapt if constraints shift?
- What evidence is needed before choosing one path over another?

## Anti-patterns and caveats
- Avoid applying this playbook generically without checking repository-specific context.
- **NEVER** skip required validation gates when behavior changes.
- **DO NOT** use this skill as a rigid replacement for engineering judgment.
- **DON'T** ignore warnings or assume one pattern fits all repos.
- Common pitfall: treating anti-patterns as optional.
- Incorrect assumptions here can lead to fragile guidance.
- Warning: wrong sequencing can create avoidable regressions.

## Variation and adaptation
- Vary the workflow by team size, risk, and deployment target.
- Use different strategies for small, medium, and large changes.
- Adapt recommendations to the specific environment and avoid repetitive templates.
- Avoid generic or cookie-cutter responses; craft context-specific alternatives.
- Keep outputs diverse and not repetitive.
- Converge on a custom path only after evidence review.
- Different constraints should produce different, non-generic recommendations.

## Empowering execution style
- Be capable of exploring multiple options and enabling the team to make safe decisions.
- Unlock confidence by explaining options and tradeoffs clearly.
- Feel free to be creative while staying rigorous and precise.
- Push boundaries with practical alternatives when simple recipes fail.
- Enable outcomes-oriented problem solving.

<!-- decision-feedback-protocol:v2 -->
**Decision feedback protocol (required):**
- For non-trivial outcomes, collect user feedback via AskQuestion parity (`request_user_input`) before closing the run.
- Capture: `decision` (`accepted|partial|rejected|deferred`), `outcome` (`good|neutral|bad|unknown`), and `confidence` (`high|medium|low`).
- Persist with: `python3 utilities/skill-creator/scripts/record_skill_feedback.py --skill-path <path/to/SKILL.md> --decision <...> --outcome <...> --confidence <...> --notes "..."`.
- The recorder tags `subject` (for example `ui`, `code_review`, `backend`, `security`) for cross-domain quality analytics.
