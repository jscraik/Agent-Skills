# Authorization checklist

Before running any interrogation:
- Confirm you own the target or have explicit written permission to test it.
- Confirm the scope (target type, environment, data boundaries).
- Confirm allowed escalation level (static only, dynamic observation, no circumvention).
- Confirm outputs and evidence handling requirements.
- If in doubt, stop and request clarification.
