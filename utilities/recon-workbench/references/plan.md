## Objective
Update the `recon-workbench` skill so its workflow, commands, and compliance notes match the current `/Users/jamiecraik/dev/recon-workbench` repo.

## Plan
1) Review repo source-of-truth docs and CLI implementation for current commands and workflow.
2) Update `SKILL.md` to reflect authorization-first flow, plan/run/summarize steps, and current subcommands.
3) Refresh eval prompts to cover rwb authorize/plan/run behavior and required Outputs/Procedure headings.
4) Validate the skill (quick_validate, skill_gate, evals) if requested/available.
