# Authorization checklist

Summary from `docs/reference/AUTHORIZATION_CHECKLIST.md`.

Before running any interrogation:
- Confirm you own the target or have explicit written permission to test it.
- Confirm scope (target type, environment, data boundaries).
- Confirm allowed escalation level.
- Confirm outputs and evidence handling requirements.
- If in doubt, stop and request clarification.
