# UK/EU Legal Notes (Not legal advice)

This project is built for:
- security analysis
- interoperability work
- understanding "ideas and principles" via observation/testing
- open-source analysis under the OSS license

It avoids guidance on bypassing DRM/TPMs or other circumvention.

## UK
UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 includes specific decompilation provisions for lawful users in limited contexts (see Section 50B reference).

## EU
EU law provides allowances for a lawful user to observe/study/test a program's functioning (subject to conditions), and allows decompilation when indispensable for interoperability (subject to conditions).

## Anti-circumvention
EU law also protects "technological measures" (TPMs). Even if observation/decompilation exceptions exist, bypassing TPMs can still be restricted.
Treat this as a constraint: prefer observation-first, and request debug/symbol builds for deeper understanding.

Consult qualified counsel if you need a definitive legal position for a specific target.
