# Metrics

Collect a quick signal before and after changes.

Examples
- TTFB and server response time for server rules.
- Bundle size and route-level JS for bundle rules.
- Interaction latency and render count for re-render rules.

Guardrails
- Prefer devtools or profiling output over intuition.
- Avoid refactors that do not change the measured metric.
