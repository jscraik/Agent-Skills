Objective: handle the 1Password edge case where required inputs are missing by gating on a minimal, explicit input set and stopping safely.

Plan:
1) Define the minimum required inputs for any 1Password action.
2) Present a short input form with required vs optional fields.
3) Specify the guardrail behavior when any required field is missing.
4) Ask for the missing inputs before doing anything else.

Next step to execute: you fill in the minimal input form below.

Minimal input form (required unless marked optional):
- Intent: `op run` | `op read` | `op inject` | `op plugin run`
- Account: `my.1password.com` (or other account shorthand)
- Target: vault/item/secret reference/template path (specific)
- Output: where the secret goes (stdout/file/env/file path)
- Environment: local/dev/prod (if applicable)
- Tmux: available? yes/no (required by policy)

Optional:
- Item field/attribute (if using `op read`)
- Template variables (if using `op inject`)
- OP_* env vars already set
- Any constraints (e.g., no file writes)

Guardrail behavior:
- If any required field is missing, I stop and ask only for those fields.
- No `op` commands are proposed until all required fields are present.
- I will not proceed without tmux availability.

Do you want to fill in the minimal input form now? (yes/no)
