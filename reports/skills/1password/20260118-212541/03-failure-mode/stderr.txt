**Confirming skill and file access**

The user wants instructions from AGENTS.md, so I'll access the agents-md skill and read the AGENTS.md file via the filesystem in read-only mode to proceed.

**Identifying missing README and docs**

I see there's no README or documentation directory, but instructions appear in files like /.codex/AGENTS.override.md, so I'll prioritize reading those to understand usage and requirements.

codex
Using the agents-md skill: I need to draft `AGENTS.md` for `/Users/jamiecraik/dev/agent-skills` from real repo commands and required global instructions.

Plan:
1. Read required global instructions (AGENTS.override/AGENTS + instructions/).
2. Scan repo docs/configs for real commands and paths.
3. Draft `AGENTS.md` (200–400 words) with required sections.
4. Validate commands/paths and unknowns.
5. Share draft and next-step options.

Next step: get the required global instruction files that I cannot access due to sandbox limits.

I currently cannot read `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/AGENTS.override.md`, `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/AGENTS.md`, or `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/instructions/` (access denied outside `/Users/jamiecraik/dev`).  
Binary question: Can you paste those files (or copy them into `/Users/jamiecraik/dev/agent-skills/.codex/` so I can read them)?
