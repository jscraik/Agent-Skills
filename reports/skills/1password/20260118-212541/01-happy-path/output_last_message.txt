Objective: Use the 1Password skill to walk through a typical, safe 1Password CLI request with explicit steps and concrete outputs.  
Plan:
1. Confirm scope of the “typical request” (install/sign-in vs. reading/injecting secrets).
2. Choose the correct 1Password CLI path (`op run` / `op read` / `op inject`) and required inputs.
3. Provide the exact tmux-based command sequence (per skill guardrail).
4. Define what “done” means and any verification checks.

Next step: confirm which “typical request” you want me to simulate (e.g., sign-in + `op whoami` + `op run` with a `.env` template).

Note: I could not read `/Users/jamiecraik/.codex/USER_PROFILE.md` due to sandbox restrictions. If you need that applied, please provide the relevant Assistant Brief content or a path I can access.

Do you want me to proceed with a standard 1Password CLI sign-in + `op run` flow in a tmux session (yes/no)?
