Objective: handle the 1Password edge case when required inputs are missing, and identify exactly what’s needed to proceed.

Plan:
1) Identify the specific 1Password task and target (op run/read/inject/plugin).
2) List required inputs for that task.
3) Flag missing inputs and the minimal safe defaults (if any).
4) Provide the next single step to unblock.

Next step: specify the exact 1Password operation you want (e.g., `op read` a secret, `op run` a command, or `op inject` a template).

## Inputs
Missing:
- The desired 1Password operation (`op read` / `op run` / `op inject` / plugin flow)
- The target secret reference or file/template path
- The account/vault context (if multiple accounts/vaults apply)

Should I proceed with the minimal assumption that you want a single secret read via `op read`?
