Objective: use the 1Password skill for a typical request in this repo and produce concrete, verifiable steps.  
Plan (proposed):
1) Confirm the exact “typical request” (goal, secret source, target file/command).
2) Verify prerequisites (`op` + tmux) and account context.
3) Start a fresh tmux session and sign in via `op signin`.
4) Choose the correct path (`op run` / `op read` / `op inject`).
5) Execute the workflow and capture redacted results.
Next step: define the specific “typical request” so I can run the correct 1Password flow.

## Inputs
- Which typical request should I execute? (e.g., “inject secrets into a `.env` template and run a command”)
- Target command or file path (e.g., `./scripts/dev.sh` or `.env.template`)
- 1Password account/vault name (or confirm default)

## Outputs
- None yet; waiting on the chosen request.

Do you want me to proceed with a standard `op run` flow for a `.env` template in this repo? (yes/no)
