Objective: acknowledge the $1password invocation is out of scope and clarify the actual task you want handled.

Plan:
1) Confirm whether to proceed without the 1password skill.
2) If yes, collect the actual task request.
3) If no, ask for a 1password‑related goal and required inputs.

Next step: decide whether to proceed without the 1password skill.

## When to use
Use the 1password skill only when the task requires 1Password CLI usage (e.g., `op signin`, `op run`, `op read`, `op inject`, secret references, or environment/secret injection workflows).

## Inputs
- Actual task request (currently missing).

## Outputs
- A structured response for the correct skill or a direct solution once scope is clarified.

Do you want me to ignore `$1password` and handle a different task instead?
