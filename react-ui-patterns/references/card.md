# Cards

## Intent
Group related content with a clear visual boundary.

## Minimal pattern
- Use a consistent padding and border radius token.
- Keep one primary action per card when possible.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid nesting cards excessively.

## Accessibility
- Ensure interactive cards are focusable and labeled.
