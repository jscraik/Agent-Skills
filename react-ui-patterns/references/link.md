# Links

## Intent
Provide navigation or secondary actions without implying a form submission.

## Minimal pattern
- Use links for navigation, buttons for actions.
- Maintain consistent underline/hover behavior.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid using links to trigger destructive actions.

## Accessibility
- Ensure link text is descriptive.
