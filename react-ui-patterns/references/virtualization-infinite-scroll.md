# Virtualization and Infinite Scroll

## Intent
Render large lists efficiently while preserving performance.

## Minimal pattern
- Use virtualization for large datasets.
- Provide a manual "Load more" fallback for accessibility.

## Pitfalls
- Avoid infinite scroll without a way to reach the footer.

## Accessibility
- Provide keyboard-accessible controls and announce loading states.
