# Ralph Plan

**Note:** In the Golden Ralph Loop, the PRD file (`prd.json` or `PRD.md`) is the authoritative source of truth for tasks. This file is kept for compatibility but is not used by `ralph-gold`.

If you prefer manual planning over the PRD format, you can use this file as a work queue:

1. [ ] Task 1 (reference: PRD story ID or file:line-range)
2. [ ] Task 2 (reference: PRD story ID or file:line-range)

Keep each item small enough to complete in 1-2 iterations.
