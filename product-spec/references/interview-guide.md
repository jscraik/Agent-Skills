# Interview Guide (use in Step 0.5)

Cover every area thoroughly; ask probing follow-ups and challenge assumptions.

## Problem & Context (5W1H: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)
- What specific problem are we solving? What happens if we don’t?
- Who feels this pain most? How do they cope today?
- When/where does it occur most? What precedes it?
- Prior attempts and why they failed or fell short.

## Users & Stakeholders
- All user types and stakeholders; roles and decision authority.
- Technical sophistication; devices/environments.
- Privacy/security expectations or constraints.

## Functional Requirements
- Walk end-to-end user journey; note decision points.
- Error cases and edge cases; recovery paths.
- Data flows: what data moves where and when.

## Technical Constraints
- Required integrations/systems.
- Performance targets (latency, throughput, availability) now and in 2 years.
- Scale expectations; regulatory/compliance needs.

## UX Considerations
- Desired experience; critical flows; information density.
- Mobile vs desktop priorities; accessibility requirements.

## Tradeoffs & Priorities
- If cuts are needed, what goes first? Speed vs quality vs cost?
- Build vs buy; non-negotiables.

## Risks & Concerns
- What could cause failure? Hidden assumptions? External dependencies? What keeps you up at night?

## Success Criteria
- Metrics that prove success; minimum viable outcome; what “exceeds expectations” looks like.

Interview rules: use multiple `AskUserQuestion` turns; do not accept vague answers; surface contradictions; ask about unstated but likely requirements (security, analytics, operability).
