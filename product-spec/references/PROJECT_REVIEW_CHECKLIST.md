# Project Review Checklist (Quality Gate)

> Rule: If an item is not applicable, mark it `N/A` and explain why.

## Vision and Problem Fit
- [ ] Original vision is reconstructed from evidence (docs/issues/commits)
- [ ] Problem statement is clear and tied to a real user
- [ ] Personas are specific
- [ ] Hypothesis is explicit (what change → what outcome)

## Evidence
- [ ] There is real evidence of demand OR a concrete plan to gather it
- [ ] Success metrics exist (numeric target + measurement method)
- [ ] Guardrails exist (what must not regress)
- [ ] Kill criteria defined (when to stop/pivot)

## Gap Analysis
- [ ] Product gaps enumerated (stories, UX, edge cases)
- [ ] Engineering gaps enumerated (APIs, data, security, reliability)
- [ ] Operational gaps enumerated (dashboards, alerts, rollback, runbooks)
- [ ] Each gap has a proposed owner/action

## Viability
- [ ] Feasibility assessment exists (time/cost/complexity)
- [ ] Differentiation is defined (why it wins)
- [ ] Scope is re-centered on usefulness (not feature count)

## Output Quality
- [ ] Recommendations are actionable with “done when” criteria
- [ ] Updated PRD/Tech Spec/ADRs are listed as follow-up deliverables
