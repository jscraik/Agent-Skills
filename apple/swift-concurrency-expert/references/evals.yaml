      I am seeing Swift 6 Sendable errors in this ViewModel:

      ```swift
      final class UserViewModel {
          var user: User
          init(user: User) { self.user = user }

          func refresh() async {
              let updated = await fetchUser()
              user = updated
          }
      }
      ```

      Error: "Sending 'UserViewModel' risks causing data races".
      Swift 6 strict concurrency is set to Complete.

      Please fix the code and explain the isolation choices.
